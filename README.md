# ViPER4WindowsCtrlPanel
This is the decompiled source code from the final version of the viper4windows control panel. It has been updated to use dotnet framework version 4.8 which is the latest as of 5/3/23.
To build and use, simply download the repo, open the solution in visual studio and build to either x64 or x86, depending on the .dll architecture type you have.

# Important notices
To use the control panel, you still need the original .dll files that came with the program. This source code is only for the control panel itself, not the .dll files.
